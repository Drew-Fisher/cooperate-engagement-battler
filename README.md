That quantity is totalled and then will be sent to the back-end server to be tallied for the user. Also included here will need to be some sort of authentication system.

This will be a Typescript NodeJS REST API server with ExpressJS that will store user post engagement in a PostreSQL database.

## Discord Bot
This will be a discord bot that will help users engage with the back-end server and report the results and leaderboard of user engagement.


## Brainstorm (Ideas and plans)
* You get a point for liking a post
* You can use your point(s) to open loot from the post
    * With the loot, you can attack other users on the leaderboard to raise your spot
    * Perhaps you can steal their points, or lose your points to them
